24 Hour Battle of the Seven Castles :
-------------------------------------
It is similar to a small evaluation report for each player how their castles are performing. 
Before the war every player can choose to attack one of the other 6 castles or defend his own.
During the war the bot sums up all the defense stats from the players defending that castle and all the attack stats of the players attacking it. 
If the attack is higher, attackers breach in and steal gold from all the people from the castle, which gets distributed between the attackers. 
If the defence is higher, then attackers lose and defenders steal attackers' gold.


Quests :
--------
Each quest is just a random text message selected from a set of texts awarding the player with a certain number of exp points and gold.
Each quest will be stored in the table and be retrieved in a random manner via it's id. 
We are planning to have around 10 different quests initially but will add more eventually.
